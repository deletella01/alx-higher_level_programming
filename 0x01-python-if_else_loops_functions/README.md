## Python - if/else, loops, functions

### If Statements
There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional. The keyword elif is short for else if, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An if...elif...elif sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.

### For Statements
The For statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Pythons for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.

### The range() Function
If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function range() comes in handy. It generates arithmetic progressions.

### Break and continue Statements, and else Clauses on Loops
The break statement, like in C, breaks out of the innermost enclosing for or while loop.

Loop statements may have an else clause; it is executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion of the iterable (with for) or when the condition becomes false (with while), but not when the loop is terminated by a break statement.
