## JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects).

As with many things in JavaScript, creating an object often begins with defining and initializing a variable.
An object is made up of multiple members, each of which has a name and a value. Each name/value pair must be separated by a comma, and the name and value in each case are separated by a colon.

## Classes and constructors
You can declare a class using the class keyword.

Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.

Classes are in fact "special functions", and just as you can define function expressions and function declarations, a class can be defined in two ways: a class expression or a class declaration.
